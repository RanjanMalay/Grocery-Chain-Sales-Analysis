# Grocery-Chain-Sales-Analysis

The Project is about the Sales analysis of Maven Market, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States. 
In this project the client wants a descriptive report on all the segments of the Data which can affect the business decisions.

Our client needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends and forecasts, 
and identify high-value customers. All Iâ€™ve been given is a folder of raw csv files, containing information about transactions, returns, products, customers and territories.

Here I have worked through the entire business intelligence workflow: connecting and shaping the source data, building a relational model, 
adding calculated columns and measures, and designing an interactive report.

The report described these following insights:-

(1) Monthly trend of Sale transactions, revenue and profit.
(2)Country wise sales transactions.
(3)Top product by sell
(4)Top product by return.
(5)Weekdays and weekend Sales trend
(6)Revenue and profit trend
(7)Brand wise Revenue% ,Profit% and Return%
(8)Weekly profit and return trend.
(9)Customer wise revenue, profit and transaction
(10)Customer transactions by education, gender and membership card and occupation
(11)Store wise transaction, revenue ,profit and return
(12)YTD revenue
(13)Quarterly and yearly transactions
(14)Revenue contribution % by store type and state
(15)Transactions by Individual Store
(16)Monthly revenue contribution by type of store.
